<h2>What To Expect</h2>
<p>
  We are a church plant made up of those of various ages and backgrounds. You
  will find that our services consist of Scripture readings, worship music that
  includes contemporary and traditional songs, prayer, and preaching. Preaching
  is central to our service, so you will hear Bible-based sermons that average
  45 minutes. Wondering how to dress? You will fit in whether you dress more
  formally or casually. Come as you are! Wondering what to do about your kids?
  At ekklesia, you will find many children sitting in the service with their
  parents, but a nursery is also available with audio of the service. Lunch
  afterwards is a sandwich buffet and we hope you will stay and eat so we can
  get to know you and you us. It is free, and you should feel no need to provide
  anything. We hope to see you Sunday!
