<h2>What To Expect</h2>
<p>
  We are a small, close-knit church made up of local families and students
  meeting at <a href="http://www.thelyric.com/" target="_blank">The Lyric</a>. Our service runs from 10:00 -
  11:45 and is centered on a Biblical sermon that lasts about 45 minutes.
  Dress is casual. We have many children and all are welcome in our services,
  though a nursery is available for those who need it. Come worship our great God with us!
