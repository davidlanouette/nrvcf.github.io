In Scripture, we find three distinct groups of people who exercise some form of leadership in the church: the congregation, consisting of all church members; elders, those men appointed to spiritual oversight in the church; and deacons, who serve the congregation in hands-on, practical ways. It is our understanding that these groups work in concert to lead, with the congregation vested with preeminent authority in major decisions (i.e., in matters of doctrine and discipline). Bound to no outside association, body, or organization, the congregation is in authority over itself under God.

In their role as overseers, the elders guide the church, particularly focusing on matters concerning teaching, preaching, and prayer. The deacons, pictured not as a second legislative body but as a group of able servants, assist the elders by facilitating ministry.

If you have any questions concerning Elders or other issues concerning Baptist Church Polity, we highly recommend www.9marks.org as a resource.

For the specific question of Elders, read the excellent treatment by Mark Dever called "Baptists and Elders" on that website.

**Doug Short, Pastor**

Our pastor, Doug Short, was raised near Columbia, Maryland.  His coming to Blacksburg, however, is a homecoming of sorts.  His father grew up in Radford and then moved to West Virginia where he met Doug's mom and, after marrying, they made their first home in Blacksburg (they now reside in Boones Mill just South of Roanoke).

Doug received a B.S. in Social Studies Education from the University of Maryland and a M.Div. from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, North Carolina.

In 1997, Doug and his family moved to Middletown, Delaware to start their first church which was well-known for its community involvement.  In 2003, the Shorts relocated to Millsboro, Delaware to begin work on their second church (both of these were a part of the Maryland/Delaware Baptist Convention- SBC) where they had unique ministries to the beach and skateboarding crowds.  The Shorts relocated to the Blacksburg area in April 2007- actually moving on the day of the Virginia Tech. shooting.

Doug has been married to Michelle (who he met in a college Bible study) since 1990 and they have three great kids:  Kailee, Nathaniel, and Benjamin.


**Drew Grumbles**

Drew first came to Ekklesia in 2007, right about the time Ekklesia began meeting on Sunday mornings, and has been there ever since. At that time, he was a student at Virginia Tech. He finished his Bachelor's degree at VT in Religious Studies and Philosophy and then decided to attend seminary at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, NC. Because he wanted to stay at Ekklesia, he is currently earning his degree by taking distance courses and commuting.

In January 2011, the congregation chose Drew to serve as an elder.

He works at Craftmaster in Christiansburg for his employment. He has been married to his wife Helen since 2009 and is the father of two children, Owen (born in 2010) and Clara (born in 2011).
