The New Testament was originally written in Greek and the word “ekklesia” is the Greek word  for “assembly” which our English Bibles translate as “church.”

We find Jesus using this word when he says to Peter:  ‘And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church (ekklesia), and the gates of Hades will not overcome it” (Matthew 16:18).

And so, “Ekklesia Blacksburg” is a fancy way of calling ourselves a simple name:  “(the) Church (in) Blacksburg.”
