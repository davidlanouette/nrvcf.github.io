All are welcome!

We are currently meeting at 10:30AM for worship at <a href="http://www.thelyric.com/" target="_blank">The Lyric</a> in downtown Blacksburg (135 College Avenue, Blacksburg, VA 24060).


Understanding the church to be a family and a community, we attempt to organize our mornings as such.

So, for example, we do not separate our children out during our worship services but are delighted to have them worship with us (See "Concerning Children's and Youth Groups" on our "Why We Do What We Do" page). We have notebooks and crayons available to keep restless hands occupied, but we do not expect your children to be silent.  Kids will be kids and we are happy, and believe it is important, to have them with you in the service learning from mom and dad the importance of worshiping together as a family.

We do have a nursery available for children up to age four, but it is not obligatory and our moms will often be seen cradling their babies in the service and taking a brief walk out in the lobby.
