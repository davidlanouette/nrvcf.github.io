To date, we have assisted the local medical missions ministry, "International Christian Resources," in their efforts in El Salvador and Kenya and intend on working further with them.

But we are also currently also working to put together a plan to accomplish our vision of identifying, equiping, sending, and providing long term support to missionaries.  Our dream is to see individuals and couples go from being active members of our own local congregation to being active missionaries on the field with whom we partner to take the Gospel to the nations.

We will not be content to send money to faceless organizations or a check to those whom we have no other contact with.  We believe that missionaries need to have a local church that is active in supporting them, that embraces the missionary's vision as their own, that will visit them on the field regularly, that will help them to train indigenous leadership as they see individuals come to Christ, that will be a place for them to return to for encouragement, and that will, yes, financially support their work.

We have been praying that the LORD will begin to put together the pieces that will enable us to see this come to fruition and are excited that He seems to be doing just that.

Our desires match that of the people of Israel reflected in Psalm 67:

God be gracious to us and bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us—that thy way may be known on the earth, thy salvation among all nations. Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all the peoples praise thee. Let the nations be glad and sing for joy; for thou wilt judge the peoples with uprightness, and guide the nations on the earth. Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all the peoples praise thee. The earth has yielded its produce; God, our God, blesses us. God blesses us, that all the ends of the earth may fear him.

Psalm 67 shows us that God's purpose is to be known and praised and enjoyed and feared among all the nations.

* To be known: verse 2—"That thy way may be known on the earth."
* To be praised: verse 3—"Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all      the peoples praise thee."
* To be enjoyed: verse 4—"Let the nations be glad and sing for joy."
* To be feared: verse 7—"That all the ends of the earth may fear him."

We see God's people asking in verse 1 that would bless them, not for their own sake, but so that they would be able to make His way and salvation known in these ways.

We at Ekklesia pray in the same manner- that God will bless us so that we can be a blessing to the nations by spreading the glory of His name.
