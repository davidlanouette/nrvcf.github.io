Please see "Concerning Children's and Youth Groups" on our "Why We Do What We Do" page to understand our philosophy of minsitry in this matter.

We have a meeting for our children every 2nd and 4th Tuesday evening of the month starting at 7 PM.

This is not a "drop-off" event, but a time for parents to be engaged with their children in fun and games, a study of the Bible, and verse memorization.

We welcome all parents and their children to join us for this time of family fun and instruction!

Please contact us for locations and updates.
