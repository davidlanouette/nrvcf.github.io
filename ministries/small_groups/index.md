Our small groups are more intimate communities within the church which seek to enjoy, encourage and support one another as we learn more about God and His design for our lives.

In these groups we center on building community and discussing the practical application of the weekâ€™s sermon with a view to living it out alongside one another.  If you have not been to an Ekklesia Sunday morning service, our groups are a great way to be introduced to our church family and to get a feel for what it is that our church believes and does.

Our groups meet at various times during the week in various locations on the VT Campus, in Blacksburg and in Christiansburg.
