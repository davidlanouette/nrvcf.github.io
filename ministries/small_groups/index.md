We currently have two small groups, one meeting on Sunday nights at 5 pm and the other on Wednesday nights at 7 pm. Locations rotate through members' homes, so please contact us for information.

Our small groups are designed to build up our church into a community centered around God's Word. In addition, they provide an opportunity for those who may not want to step inside church doors to come into contact with a group of believers. During our time we are led to think through Sunday morning's sermon, learn how to apply it, and help each other to put Scripture into practice. All are welcome to join us!
