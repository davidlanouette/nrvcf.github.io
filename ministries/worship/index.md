All are welcome!

We are currently meeting at 10:00AM for worship at the Blacksburg Community Center on Patrick Henry Drive across from Blacksburg High School (725 Patrick Henry Drive, Blacksburg, VA 24060).

A fellowship meal immediately follows.


Understanding the church to be a family and a community, we attempt to organize our mornings as such.

So, for example, we do not separate our children out during our worship services but are delighted to have them worship with us (See "Concerning Children's and Youth Groups" on our "Why We Do What We Do" page). We have notebooks and crayons available to keep restless hands occupied, but we do not expect your children to be silent.  Kids will be kids and we are happy, and believe it is important, to have them with you in the service learning from mom and dad the importance of worshiping together as a family.

We do have a nursery available for children up to age four, but it is not obligatory and our moms will often be seen cradling their babies in the service and taking a brief walk out into the hallway if necessary. We also have a room next door for mothers to nurse their babies.  This room has the serviced broadcast into it so that no one needs to miss anything.

The service will be promptly followed by a meal to be enjoyed by members and guests alike.  Everyone is welcome to stay for this time of encouragement and of building community.
