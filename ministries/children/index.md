Literally, the name would mean “the assembly (in) Blacksburg.”

“Ekklesia” is the Greek word for assembly that Christ used to describe His church.  Speaking to Peter Jesus said, ‘And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church (ekklesia), and the gates of Hades will not overcome it” (Matthew 16:18).
