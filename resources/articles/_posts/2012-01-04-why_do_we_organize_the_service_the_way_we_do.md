title: Why Do We Organize the Service the Way We Do?

As explained in "Is Style A Matter of Preference?", we do what we do for a reason- not to be the most flashy or entertaining, but to bring glory to God.
This being the case, we are less concerned with being "cool" as we are with ordering our services in a way which seems to us to reflect most accurately the examples given to us in the Bible of what true worship should involve.

That being said, our morning worship service typically follows the following pattern:

The Invocation or Call to Worship
A Prayer of Confession and Assurance of Pardon
The Singing of Songs
A Responsive Reading
Prayer of Intercession
The Reading of the Sermon Text
The Sermon
Closing Song
Prayer of Dismissal

This is all then followed by our Fellowship Meal and Children's Teaching Time

So why do we do each of these?  We'd be happy to share our thinking:


The Invocation-
God, through His Word, calls His people to come before Him and worship Him. Thus, we begin each service by hearing Him call to us through His Word to come together and worship.  Typically this comes through a reading from the Psalms. Through this we not only hear God's call, we also recognize our dependence on Him and ask Him to make his presence known among us as we worship.

Prayer of Confession and Assurance of Pardon-
Hearing the call of a holy God to come and worship Him, we prepare our hearts to do just that by humbling ourselves in confession of our sins. We then hear His promise of forgiveness.

Music-
In response to God's forgiveness and grace through Jesus Christ, we praise Him in song.

From beginning to end, the Bible is full of music and song. The first musician, Jubal, makes his appearance as early as Genesis 4, where we are told that “he was the father of all who play the harp and flute” (v.21). As we turn the pages, we find many who follow in Jubal’s musical footsteps. Moses sang a song of praise after the Exodus; Deborah sang after the victory over Sisera; King David played the harp, and wrote many of the Psalms; the Lord Jesus sang a hymn with his disciples at the last supper; Paul and Silas sang a hymn of praise to God in jail; and the book of Revelation tells us that there is plenty of singing in heaven as the heavenly choir joins in praise to God.

The Bible makes it clear that we are not to wait until heaven; it contains frequent exhortations to us to sing. For example:

“Come let us sing for joy to the Lord” (Ps. 95:1)

“Sing to the Lord a new song, for He has done marvellous things” (Ps. 98:1)

 “Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs.  Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord” (Eph. 5:19)

At New River Valley Christian Fellowship you will find a mixture of both newer songs and older hymns. You will also find an emphasis on congregational singing. This does not mean that we don't have musicians leading us in worship, but it does mean we do not have a rock band that will drown out the voices of the people of God. We believe the Bible commands a joyful reverence, as we all together lift our voices and hearts to the Lord.


Responsive Reading-
We recognize that when we gather as a church, we are more than a group of individuals. We are individuals all joined to one body. We are part of the universal church founded by our Lord. In our responsive reading, we confess truths about God, whether from the Scriptures or from ancient creeds, that have been guarded for thousands of years. This reminds us of the truths we believe, but it also serves for us to encourage each other, as we see that God has brought people from all walks of life to confess the same truths that we each hold dear.

Prayer of Intercession-
Paul wrote, "I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way" (1 Tim. 2:1-2). We follow this instruction by praying for those who rule over us, as well as for our brothers and sisters across the globe.

The Preaching of God's Word-
At New River Valley Christian Fellowship we preach expositionally. This means that each message seeks to declare the point of a particular Biblical passage and reflect on its application to our modern situation.

Rather than offer sermons such as "Top 5 Ways to Experience Success in Life," which are rarely very helpful, we simply let God speak through His Word anticipating that He will minister to our hearts and minds in ways that we could not hope to summarize in 3 or 5 point ditties.

Sermons usually last about 45 minutes and are packed with material for reflection. Our sermon series usually consist of preaching through an entire book of the Bible, with the conviction that every part of God's Word is relevant to our lives. On a regular basis, our sermon series will alternate between the Old and New Testaments. All preaching is gospel-driven.
