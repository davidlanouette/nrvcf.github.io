title: Concerning Children's and Youth Groups

On November 11, 2011,  Wayne Rice, one of the founders of the largest, most influential student ministry organization, Youth Specialties, confessed: “We got what we wanted. We turned youth ministry into the toy department of the church. Churches now hire professionals to lead youth ministry. We got relevance but we created a generation of teenagers who
are a mile wide and are an inch deep.”

Statistics have been showing us for years that we have a real problem when it comes to our youth and their commitment to the church when they are out on their own.  One latest poll claimed that a full 80% of the youth who grow up in church drop out when they enter college.

Why is that?

We believe that much of the blame falls on the children's and youth groups that exist in the local church (we are not completely against them, mind you, but believe that they do need to be reformed as discussed below).

Rather than equipping our children to understand the Gospel and to love the church, and rather than equipping our students to be adults who understand, at the very least, basic doctrine and to live as missionaries, we have raised them to love fun and games.  They have been taught, even if unintentionally, that church is only relevant to them as long as it is "fun" and "exciting."

So what happens when they are expected to sit through "adult services," and what happens when they go off to college and discover that their town doesn't have a "cool" church with all the bells and whistles that they have come to expect?

We are discovering that, if a church doesn't offer a hip subculture where the young people are not catered to, they give up on the church.

To his credit, Wayne Rice then argued for three changes:
1. Turn student ministry back over to the church. Youth pastors should be seeking to work themselves out of a job as they help youth become incorporated into the life of the church.
2. We can no longer ignore the role of the parents.
3. We can offer them nothing better than the gospel.

We agree wholeheartedly.  That is why we have taken a different approach.

CHILDREN ATTENDING OUR SERVICES

First, there is an adage that says that, with children, values are "caught more than they are taught."

If there is any truth to this (and there is), then it should strike us as remarkable that the one time during the week that parents sing songs of worship along with their church family, the one time during the week that they recite out loud confessions of what they believe, the one time that they sit under the teaching of the Bible with their Bibles in their laps, is a time when we usher their children away from their presence so that the children  cannot witness their parents doing any of this.  Does this not strike you as odd?

We do.  And so, all along, we have had our children sit with their parents during our services.  We don't necessarily expect them to understand everything that is happening or every point from the sermon (though it is always surprising to hear just how much they do understand), but we do expect them to learn from their parent's example.  And this alone is worth the effort.

And, sometimes, it is an effort.  We know that getting a kid to sit still during church can, potentially, be a trying ordeal- at first.  But, experience has shown us, that, without exception, when a child is taught that they are expected to sit through a service with his/her parents, they learn to do so.  For some it takes a little longer than others, but there always comes a point where they learn to quietly sit while the service goes on.  Knowing this to be true, and believing this to be the best thing for the child, and the parents in their fulfilling their role of instilling godly values in their children, we expect the kids to sit with their parents and we are patient with those who are in the process of learning.   We don't expect that children who are learning will be silent and completely still and we don't mind a little noise.  In fact,  it makes us feel more like family.

We do provide a nursery for those little ones who are at an age where they may need a break to unwind and for nursing mothers to be able to do so in privacy.  The service is broadcast into this room.

PARENTS TEACHING THEIR KIDS

We also involve the parents in the education of the children.  We used to follow the practice of so many churches in trying to drum up volunteers to work with the children and, often times, college students would be those who would, graciously, step up to the plate.

There came a time, however, when we asked ourselves:  "Why aren't the ones who are responsible for teaching their children the ones who are expected to do so?"  And so we asked the parents:  "How about you teach your kids together?" and they enthusiastically took over.  While we enjoy all the parents being involved, we expect that, in a two-parent home, that the dads will take the lead role.  This doesn't mean that we expect all the dads to be biblical scholars when they come to us and we certainly aren't going to put them on the spot in front of the rest of the church.  It simply means that a dad needs to be willing to be there and experience our children's program together with his kid.

We did have a time for the parents and children to learn together every Sunday morning, but with our fellowship meal following the services, the parents decided that it was a bit much to try and cram everything into one day.  So we now have a children's meeting that meets every 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month at 7 PM.  Here the parents have a time to play games with their kids (we still think having fun is a good thing- expecially when it is the parents who are doing the fun with their kids!), a Bible lesson, and Bible verse memorization.  This has been a great success with both chidlren and parents alike saying that they have a blast.

GOSPEL CENTERED

And what are the children being taught?  Our desire is for them to love the Word and the Savior to whom it points.  And so our lessons are Gospel-centered.  At the writing of this essay, we are taking our children through a study of Christ in all of the Scriptures- starting with the Old Testament.  Our desire is for them to have an appreciation for ALL of the Bible and to understand that it all points to Jesus.

CONCERNING YOUTH

We are not opposed to having youth events or studies which appeal particularly to the issues they face.  However, we do not believe that the youth need a pastor that is different than the one that their parents have.  Nor do they need to sit through a separate service than the one which their parents do.  They need to be taught that the older generations have much to offer them and they, likewise, have much to offer the older generations.  In years past, those in their teen years were expected to be able to handle the Word accurately and to serve those among whom worshipped.   Our desire is for them to learn to appreciate the Body of Christ and to be fully functioning members of it.  If they don't learn to do this now, what will they do when they go off to college?
