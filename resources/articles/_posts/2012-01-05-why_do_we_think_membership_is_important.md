To be a member of a church is to make a public promise to live according to the Word and to support the work of the congregation. In the Bible this is called a covenant. Every believer is part of the church as organism (the Spiritual Body of Christ), but only by a public promise can you be part of the church as organization. A public promise, or covenant, is the basis for all society, according to the Bible: marriage, employment, citizenship, church membership, etc., are all relationships of accountability.

Membership in a church is not like membership in a social club or other organizations. Most organization members are consumers; the organization exists to serve them. The Church of Christ is a completely different community - membership means ministry and service, going from being a consumer to becoming a provider of God's love and care to others. At Ekklesia, we take seriously that we are a church not for ourselves, but for others.

We therefore encourage all those who call Ekklesia their church home to become official members.

At Ekklesia, we have two membership options.  The first is regular full membership, the second is called an "associate membership."  An associate member is someone who is residing in Blacksburg temporarily and maintains membership in a home church to which they intend on returning.  In order to live in a covenant agreement with a local church body for the reasons listed below, the individual is encouraged to join Ekklesia as their "Blacksburg home church."  They would be expected to maintain their membership at their home church and a letter of commendation would be sought from that church.  The difference between an associate and full member is that associate members would not be able to vote in church matters.

So why should you join Ekklesia?  8 Reasons

1)  First, join for non-Christians.

John 13: 34 A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. 35 By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.

It is a way to demonstrate what the love of Christ and Christian discipleship looks like in action.  The Gospel is made visible by Christians joining together in congregations.  A non-Christian should be able to observe a congregation and say “Oh- I’m calling myself a Christian, but I’m not really living like one.  Perhaps I’m not a Christian.”  It seems that the kind of love that we as Christians should have for each other is a part of God’s plan of evangelizing the world.

2)  Join for weaker Christians.
Too often we think of God’s plan in an individualistic sense- what’s His plan for me?  What is in it for me?  As we read the Bible, however, we find that God’s plans are much larger and grander than simply what He wants for you.  God’s plan is that He wants to use you for others.  By throwing your life into other people, in a committed way, those who are weaker in their faith will be strengthened.  That is a big part of what God does through the relationships within a church.

Charles Spurgeon:
"I know there are some who say, 'Well, I have given myself to the Lord, but I do not intend to give myself to any church.'"
"Now, why not?"
"Because I can be a Christian without it."
"Are you quite clear about that? You can be as good a Christian by disobedience to your Lord's command as by being obedient? There is a brick. What is it made for? To help build a house. It is of no use for that brick to tell you that it is just as good a brick while it is kicking about on the ground as it would be in the house. It is a good-for-nothing brick. So you rolling-stone Christians, I do not believe that you are answering your purpose. You are living contrary to the life which Christ would have you live, and you are much to blame for the injury you do."

3) Join for assurance of salvation.
1 Corinthians 5:1-5
"1 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father's wife. 2 And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you. 3 For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing. 4 When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 5 you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord."

One of the reasons that we join a church is because it is there to help you understand if you are truly living as a Christian.  The man in this passage likely thought of himself as a Christian and that is why Paul said it was necessary for them to take action.  It had to be made clear to him, for his sake, that his life’s actions were, in fact, that of a non-Christian.

If you think of yourself as a strong Christian and yet you cannot be committed to a group of people who have faith in Christ, then you may not have much of a reason to believe that you are truly a Christian.  The more aware we are of our own sin and the more we know of how God has forgiven us in Christ, then the more that kind of love should find itself out of our own hearts into the lives of other people- especially those who are your brothers and sisters in Christ.

4) Join for spiritual safety.
As Christians, we are involved in a battle. Our arch-enemy is Satan who "walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour" (1 Peter 5:8). The way in which he devours unwary people is by tempting them to sin—by convincing them that sin is a more rewarding master than Christ. He therefore disguises himself and his agents, and he makes the pleasures of sin appear very appealing to us.

That is why we are told to "exhort one another daily . . . lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin" (Hebrews 3:13). That is why Paul said to the church at Rome that they, being "full of all goodness, filled with all knowledge," were to "admonish one another" (Romans 15:14). And that is why, in the familiar passage in Hebrews chapter 10, we are told to "consider one another in order to stir up love and good works." These passages all speak of the fellowship of the church as a preventative measure—a means of restraining one another from sin.

Never in the New Testament are Christians told to "tough it out" on their own. On the contrary, Paul tells us "let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.”

We are not called to live the Christian life apart from the protection of the church. The fellowship of a group of committed believers is vital to our spiritual health and to our endurance in the faith. This need for the protection of committed brothers and sisters is seen most clearly in the fact that even with it, many Christians fall into sin. In Galatians 6:1, Paul writes, "Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted. "

5)  Join for the sake of maturity.
It tests our claims of love.  John writes in 1 John:  “This is how we know what love is, that Jesus Christ laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.”  Christian love is not just a general sense of having a kind disposition toward everybody we run across through the day.  It includes that, but at the heart of it is something much stronger.  It is a love that is especially focused on other Christians and particularly on other Christians that you are a part of- the Christians that you actually see and have contact with.

Theology is very important- but if you are not willing to drive an elderly person to church, or to help watch a young child or simply encourage others in their faith, then it is not clear that you know the love of Christ.

6) Join for obedience.
As we have already seen, both Christ and Paul give commands for how to remove unrepentant members from a church. In Matthew 18, verses 15-17, Jesus gives the church step-by-step instructions for dealing with a "brother" (a professing Christian) who falls into sin. If that "brother" persists in his sinful behavior even after being confronted privately, the matter is to be told "to the church." Unless there is some kind of established dividing line—some way of knowing who is part of the church and who is not—we have no way of properly obeying Christ's command.
Paul uses even stronger language to describe the removal of an unrepentant "brother" from the church. In 1 Corinthians chapter 5 which we looked at above, he tells that church to "deliver such a one to Satan . . . " (v. 5). He goes on to say that they were "not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral . . . not even to eat with such a person" (v. 11). Then, in verse 12, Paul makes a very interesting distinction. He writes, "For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside? " What did Paul mean by distinguishing between those who were "outside" and those who were "inside It seems clear that he was referring to some sort of separation between groups. Those who were "inside" must have been a recognized group—a list (even if it was not written down) of the people who comprised that local church. This group must have been bound together by more than just an informal relationship—not just a bond among people who said they were Christians (remember that the man who was cast out was "named a brother").

In other words, there must have been some system by which they affirmed one another as Christians—as members of that church. In what other way could these people have obediently followed Paul's instructions in verse 13 when he said, "Therefore 'put away from yourselves the evil person?'"? If a person were never affirmed or accepted as a member of that particular group, there would be no way to obey the command to remove him from that group.

In what other way could a Christian obey the command given in Hebrews 13:17, "Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive . . . "? How would a particular Christian know whom to obey, if not by committing himself to the leadership and care of a particular elder or group of elders? We certainly would not expect a Christian to follow the instructions or submit to the leadership of any and every person in his city, or state, or nation, who is considered a pastor.

7)  Join for the church leaders.
Pastors need to know who they are giving an account for.  If you are not a member of the church, the elders and deacons may not know your name, you are not being prayed over regularly, they don’t even know if you are a Christian or not.

The job of a pastor is to “equip the saints,” your job, therefore, is to be
equipped.  This is not possible if you are someone who pops in now and then.  It is not possible if you are not building committed relationships with those who are called to shepherd you.

Churches could not function if everybody were just a consumer.  If no one would commit to a church and, instead, just kept hopping from church to church and shopping around, there would be no churches.  There are no perfect churches.  We must realize this and then agree that “O.K., I’m going to settle in this place and I’m going to try and prosper here spiritually.  I agree with what they teach, their statement of faith, I agree with their summary of how we should live.  These are things in good conscious I can commit to, I will do this, I will live for Christ with these people.”

8)  Join for God.
The church is not the pastor’s idea- it is Christ’s.
If you look through the book of Acts, it is the Lord who adds people to their number and being added to the Christians number meant being identified as the church.  And who identifies with the church?  If you look at chapters 2 and 4, it is fascinating that when Paul, or Saul, is on the road to Damascus he has the vision of the risen Christ. He appears to him and Saul falls to the ground.  Do you remember what Jesus says to him?  He doesn’t say “Saul, Saul, why are you going to persecute those Christians”.  He doesn’t even say “Saul, Saul, why are you going to persecute the church.”  He says, “Saul, Saul, why are you going to persecute me.”  Jesus so clearly and closely identifies with the church that he refers to the congregation of Christians in Damascus as “me.”  That is where Paul likely got his image of the church as the body of Christ.

If Jesus is the image of the invisible God, how do we see Christ?  He is seen through the church committed to and loving one another.
