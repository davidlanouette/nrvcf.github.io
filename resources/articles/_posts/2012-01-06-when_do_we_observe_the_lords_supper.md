Please refer to the sermon "Why We Do What We Do:  The Lord's Supper" by Drew Grumbles for an explanation of our doctrinal stance on why we partake of the Supper and who should be included.

Historically, the Lord's Supper has been the focal point for a local church body to both celebrate the unity of its members in their common faith and commitment to one another, and for the church to practice church discipline.  Seeing the value and benefit of this practice, our observance of the Lord's Supper is reserved for the members of our church and is conducted during our monthly member's meeting (the 3rd Sunday of the month) following our worship services.
