Setup
=====

Before following the setup steps below, you will need to install Git and Ruby 1.9.x on your system. To get the development environment up and running, follow these steps:

```
git clone git@github.com:ekklesia/ekklesia.github.com.git
cd ekklesia.github.com
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

That's it! You can use any Rack-based application server to see the site. If you'd like, use Jekyll's built-in webserver by typing ```jekyll --server``` inside your project directory.
